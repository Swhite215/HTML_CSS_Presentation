            ###Terminology

            Some key terms or phrases that are used as a matter
            of course in the software industry. You may know
            some or all of these, or you may have heard the
            terms but be unclear about their actual meaning.
            They are common jargon among developers
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ###WEB DEVELOPMENT

            Web development is a broad term for the work
            involved in developing a web site for the Internet. In
            industry parlance,
            'web development' usually refers
            to the more code-related tasks such as programming
            JavaScript, coding HTML and CSS. It can even extend
            to tasks related to the back end server infrastructure
            such as creating web services and handling business
            logic for a company or product.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###WEB DESIGN

            The process of planning & structuring a website;
            speciÒcally, the visual aspects and assets for the site.
            Recently, this job description has also begun to
            include interaction design. That is, designing the user
            experience (UX), information architecture, and the
            Óow of the application or site.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###WEB SITE

            A largely informational web page. While they may
            include dynamic elements and react to user inputs.
            The general purpose of a web site is to provide
            information about a person, business, product, or
            service.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###WEB APPLICATION

            A more recent term to indicate a web site whose sole
            purpose is not just informational, but rather
            functional. Web applications have become robust
            enough to do everything from our taxes, manage our
            personal calendars, or even do standard desktop
            publishing tasks.

          <section data-markdown>

            ###HTML ELEMENTS

            An element is an individual component of HTML
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML TAGS

            A tag marks the beginning and end of an element.
            Tags are containers. They tell you something about
            the content between the opening & closing tags.
          </section>

            ###HTML Tag Anatomy

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML Boilerplate

            -Copy the code snippet from Padlet

            -Paste this into your index.html

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML Comments

            Like any other good coding language, HTML offers
            comments. They operate like comments in any other
            language. They allow you to make notes that are not included in the final project

            ![](images/htmlcomment.PNG)

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML Structure: Nesting

            -HTML elements 'nest' inside of one another. The
element that opens first closes last.

            -Which element tag is everything else nested within?

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML Additions

            Let's add a few extra elements to our page.

            ![](images/extraelements.PNG)

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML: Anchor Element

            Links to other sites on the web (or within your
            project) are created using this element.

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ###HTML: Attributes

            1. Provide additional information about HTML
            elements.
            2. Attribute tags include class , id , style , language ,
            href, src (source).
            3. Attributes are positioned inside the opening tag,
            before the right bracket.
            4. Attributes are paired with values. Key / value pairs
            are an important concept in programming.
            5. Selected from a pre-deÒned set of possible
            attributes depending on the element.

            1. Basics: Doctype, HTML, Head, & Body.
